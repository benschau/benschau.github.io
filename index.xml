      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s for my IDE friends that can&amp;rsquo;t exit Vim.
What is Vim? Vim (Vi-iMproved) is a free and open-source text editor. That&amp;rsquo;s it, really!
Why Vim? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked, here&amp;rsquo;s the short version:
 Vim is extendable: Vim has a billion add-ons, everything from code completion to LateX previewers are available.

      <description>This is yet another site/blog, by yours truly. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to befriend yet another internet stranger, I&amp;rsquo;m here to volunteer for that spot.
My name is Benson Chau (Ben for short), and I&amp;rsquo;m probably a better writer than I am a student.
What I plan to focus on:
 Video Games &amp;amp; the Industry
 Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not of the industry, but I do read about it often.  Consoles (of the video game variety)</description>

      <description>Hello, and welcome. My name is Benson (Ben for short, hard to get coffee otherwise). This is a site where I talk about stuff that I have interest in.
Mostly though, you&amp;rsquo;ll see me write up posts about things I enjoy and don&amp;rsquo;t. Right now, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m planning:
 A Quick Vim Introduction - per the title, an introduction to the most beloved text editor of all time. The goal is to get you up and running with Vim.</description>

      <description>Migrating from Wordpress to Github pages via hugo. Feels pretty good thus far, and I wanted to dust off my old Github home page anyway.
Introductory post coming soon, this is just a test.
