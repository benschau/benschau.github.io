      <description>This is a reboot of the blog that I had earlier at this domain; a couple years ago, I started getting pretty bogged down by college and stopped posting to keep focused. I&amp;rsquo;ve since graduated at this point, so I figured I would wipe my blog clean and do it over. So, this is that post. Switched up the theme as well, this is much more clean.
Maybe at some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll even try to self-host this site instead of running it off Github and using a different domain name for it.</description>
