			<p>Since I&rsquo;ve graduated, I&rsquo;ve finally got some time to finish some of the games
I bought a while ago. I thought it&rsquo;d be interesting to talk about how I felt
about some of those games I finished in a &lsquo;review&rsquo; of sorts. For the most
part, this retrospective does have some <strong>spoilers</strong>, since the most intriguing
part of the game is the plot.</p>
<p>To start things off, I&rsquo;ve been playing a classic from the 2010s, <a href="">Alan Wake</a>,
made by Remedy Entertainment. To put a long (but damn good) story short, it&rsquo;s about
Alan Wake, a writer, and his wife that go on a vacation to an eerie town named Bright Falls. The wife gets kidnapped by a mysterious, (obviously) evil dark entity, and
the plot rolls out from there. Alan Wake is attacked by the entity via
external forces like the Taken, which are humans consumed by the dark entity, and has to fight has way through them to save his wife.</p>
<p>For this retrospective, we&rsquo;ll talk about two elements of the game: the plot and
the gameplay.</p>
<h1 id="the-gameplay">The Gameplay</h1>
<p>Alan Wake is a generic third-person shooter, but at least tries to be inventive
with a gimmick. Most enemies have an impenetrable shield that goes away when you
shine a flashlight in their faces until they become vulnerable.</p>
<p>Throughout the nine-hours it took me to beat the game on normal/hard
(Steam gave me the achievement for both, even though there was no hard),
there were essentially only three enemy types; the Taken (w/ variants),
Poltergeists, and the Birds.</p>
<h3 id="the-taken">The Taken</h3>
<p>The Taken are your typical grunts; they use their bulletproof darkness shields
to get closer to you and try to hack you to death. For the most part, the variants
are not really all that special; some grunts (the Fodder) will throw axes
at you as they approach, others have a special ability to dash at you
(the Zoomers), and another type (the BeefBoy) can take more bullets
but walk slower with the occasional dash.</p>
<p>Having three types of Taken is not really too few, but I found it weird
that they revealed all the types so quickly and never mixed the types together as
much to make fighting them interesting, especially since they are thrown at the
player 90% of the time. For the majority of the game, the player encounters
packs of Fodder with a few BeefBoys mixed in, but never with Zoomers (except for
exactly one encounter, which even groups you up with an AI to make things easy).</p>
<p>I felt like the Taken were overdone from start to finish. It makes sense from a
plot-perspective (as we&rsquo;ll see), but it definitely doesn&rsquo;t help the gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="the-poltergeists">The Poltergeists</h3>
<p>Remedy Entertainment did try to make things a little more interesting by taking
a page out of Stephen King&rsquo;s book. To spice things up a bit, the dark entity
can take over inanimate objects and use them against you, whether it&rsquo;s by
throwing trucks and pallets or causing bulldozers to self-drive
themselves right at the player.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these enemies are never mixed in with the Taken. Moreover,
they are beaten the same way as the Taken; you just shine a flashlight at
them until they explode into fancy light particles.</p>
<h3 id="the-birds">The Birds</h3>
<p>The typical &lsquo;nuisance&rsquo; enemies; just a flock of birds that will divebomb you
after a sound cue. Really not much to say about this one; they are never thrown at
you with any other enemies around.</p>
<p>Taken all together, the enemy variety is actually really underwhelming. There&rsquo;s never
really that much of a challenge, and at some point you just know what&rsquo;s coming
(it&rsquo;s always a couple Taken and some buff special Taken). If you&rsquo;re looking
for a challenging third person shooter, this ain&rsquo;t it. The enemies in general
do definitely provide a good feel for the theme of the game, e.g light vs. dark, and
I love it for that.</p>
<p>To sum it up- Alan Wake (the game) doesn&rsquo;t really have much to
go on, gameplay-wise. If you&rsquo;re here for a particular difficult survival
horror third-person shooter, Resident Evil will most definitely be for you.
However, the gameplay is still even at worst servicable. That having been said,
I didn&rsquo;t beat Alan Wake for the gameplay.</p>
<h1 id="the-story">The Story</h1>
<p>I beat it for the story.</p>
<p>Alan Wake&rsquo;s story is excellent. Paired with the atmosphere of the game, most of which
taking place at night in the woods, it really immerses the player in the world of
Bright Falls. The game leaves just enough information out of reach to get the player
to continue playing the game even though the gameplay itself has significant
shortcomings. Because the enemies are rather well-integrated into the story, it&rsquo;s
not as big of a deal that the gameplay amounts to another third-person shooter.</p>
<p>Without spoiling too much, I think what makes the story interesting is
that the game is really about how Alan Wake wasn&rsquo;t all that great of a guy. It&rsquo;s
about his writer&rsquo;s block and how it affected his marriage. Alan&rsquo;s quest to
save his wife from the Dark Presence and his wife&rsquo;s fear of the darkness draws
parallels to how Alan treated his wife after his first (and technically only)
success in writing and his writer&rsquo;s block.</p>
<p>The story is largely based on the these manuscript pages that you can pick up
throughout the game. The pages are actually literally telling the future of the
game, usually right before the event happens. It&rsquo;s an interesting narrative device;
by telling the player what will happen but not when, it fuels anticipation and
serves as a &lsquo;breadcrumb&rsquo; to keep the players invested. Moreover, it contributes
to one of the more interesting payoffs in the game&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a very contained yet well-written story. Although it does technically
spoon-feed you the narrative through the manuscript pages, I think it&rsquo;s a unique
narrative device that has enough pros that it was hard for me to look back on it
as a negative. The writers wrapped the story up and put a nice bow on top.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>I would <strong>recommend</strong> Alan Wake for those that are looking for a good story. Granted,
some story elements are rather typical, but I don&rsquo;t think it takes away from the
story as a whole. You don&rsquo;t need all unique elements to create something positive.
While the gameplay is on the basic side, it&rsquo;s servicable. It doesn&rsquo;t take away
from the story, but I would argue actually adds to it through the atmosphere and
immersion.</p>
<p>The game goes on sale quite often; I picked it up for $2 on Steam a few months ago.
It&rsquo;s well-worth grabbing it then.</p>
<p>(If you consider the possibilities, the gameplay could have been
vastly improved; however, if you consider the possibilities for everything,
everything is disappointing.)</p>
